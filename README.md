Wacky Words is a web application that allows people of any age to amuse themselves with words they don’t understand. Not only is Wacky Words amusing, it is useful and intellectual. When the user receives their “wacky word”, they are likely to resort to analyzing the root words in order to determine the correct definition, which will inadvertently make our app a learning experience! In the game, there is a time limit of 1 minute to answer as many questions as possible. The user get points for answering questions correctly, but you lose points for incorrect answers.
